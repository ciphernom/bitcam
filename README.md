# BitCam: A Protocol for Digital Observation

## The Evolution of Trusted Observation

Throughout human history, the need to trust observation has been fundamental to social organization. Early human societies developed sophisticated protocols for verifying claims about observed events, evolving from simple witness testimony to complex systems of notaries, seals, and timestamped documentation.

### Origins of Witness Protocols

The earliest human tribes faced a crucial challenge: how to verify claims about events not personally witnessed by all members. This challenge directly impacted group survival - knowing which hunting grounds were productive, which water sources were safe, which territories held dangers. False claims could be fatal; trust was essential but verification was crucial.

These early societies developed three key innovations:

1. **Continuous Presence** - Witnesses had to be physically present throughout an event. Many cultures required witnesses to perform specific actions or rituals during observation to prove continuous attention.

2. **Resource Commitment** - Acting as a witness required significant resource commitment. Australian Aboriginal songlines required witnesses to memorize vast amounts of information. Roman witnesses had to physically travel to events. Medieval notaries spent years building reputations.

3. **Temporal Proofs** - Societies developed ways to prove when events occurred. Islamic scholars created unbroken chains of teacher-student relationships spanning centuries. European courts required witnesses to tie observations to astronomical events or feast days.

### The Digital Transformation

The digital revolution fundamentally broke these natural limitations. Digital content can be:
- Created without presence
- Copied without cost
- Modified without trace
- Claimed without consequence

This transformation has created a crisis of trust in digital observation. Video evidence, once considered nearly irrefutable, now faces growing skepticism. The natural guarantees of physical presence have been lost.

## Solution

We propose a system for digital video recording that proves continuous observation through an unforgeable chain of proof-of-work secured merkle trees. The system creates cryptographic proof that each segment of video was recorded sequentially in real-time, with periodic anchoring to Bitcoin's timechain providing broad temporal boundaries. This creates verifiable evidence of both the recording's continuity and temporal placement, making it computationally infeasible to fabricate alternative histories of the recording.

## 1. Introduction

Digital video evidence faces a fundamental challenge: while cryptographic signatures can prove a specific party endorsed a specific video file, they cannot prove when the video was actually recorded or that the recording was continuous. Current approaches attempt to solve this through trusted third parties, specialized hardware, or simple content hashing, all of which fail to prove continuous recording in real-time.

What's needed is a system that:
1. Proves each segment was recorded sequentially
2. Makes it computationally infeasible to modify past segments
3. Creates verifiable temporal boundaries
4. Operates without trusted third parties

## 2. System Overview

The BitCam protocol divides video recording into fixed-length segments (typically 1 second), creating a merkle tree of segments where:

1. Each leaf node contains:
   - Video segment data
   - Segment hash
   - Timestamp
   - Proof-of-work nonce

2. Each internal node contains:
   - Combined hash of children
   - Proof-of-work nonce
   - Temporal metadata

3. Periodic root nodes are timestamped through the Bitcoin timechain using OpenTimestamps

## 3. Segment Proof Construction

For each video segment S₍ᵢ₎, we create its leaf node L₍ᵢ₎:

```
L₍ᵢ₎ = {
    data: S₍ᵢ₎,
    hash: H(S₍ᵢ₎),
    timestamp: T₍ᵢ₎,
    nonce: N₍ᵢ₎
}
```

Where H is SHA-256 and N₍ᵢ₎ must satisfy:

```
H(L₍ᵢ₎ || N₍ᵢ₎) ≤ 2^(256-D)
```

Where D is the current difficulty target.

## 4. Merkle Tree Construction

The merkle tree is built from these leaf nodes, where each internal node I₍ᵢ₎ requires its own proof-of-work:

```
I₍ᵢ₎ = {
    hash: H(L₍ᵢ₎ || L₍ᵢ₊₁₎),
    nonce: N₍ᵢ₎,
    metadata: {
        timestamp: T₍ᵢ₎,
        level: level₍ᵢ₎
    }
}
```

The proof-of-work requirement for internal nodes ensures that:
1. Tree reconstruction must be performed sequentially
2. Alternative histories require recomputing all subsequent proofs
3. Multiple valid trees cannot be computed in parallel

## 5. Security Through Proof-of-Work

The key innovation is requiring proof-of-work at both the segment and merkle tree level. This creates security through:

1. **Sequential Construction**
   - Each segment's proof depends on previous segment
   - Each node's proof depends on child nodes
   - Forces real-time, ordered processing

2. **Computational Binding**
   - Modifying any segment requires recomputing:
     * That segment's proof
     * All parent node proofs
     * All subsequent segment proofs
   - Makes retroactive modification infeasible

3. **Resource Commitment**
   - Processing must occur in real-time
   - Computational work cannot be precomputed
   - Multiple recordings require separate resources

## 6. Temporal Anchoring

While proof-of-work secures the local ordering and integrity of segments, broad temporal boundaries are established through:

1. Periodic OpenTimestamps of merkle roots
2. Inclusion of Bitcoin block height in timestamp metadata
3. Cross-validation of timestamps against proof-of-work timing

This creates a temporal proof that:
1. Recording started after time T₍start₎
2. Recording ended before time T₍end₎
3. Segments are correctly ordered within these bounds

## 7. Protocol Verification

Any party can verify a recording by:

1. Validating segment proofs:
   ```
   For each segment S₍ᵢ₎:
     Verify H(L₍ᵢ₎ || N₍ᵢ₎) ≤ 2^(256-D)
     Verify sequential ordering
   ```

2. Validating merkle tree:
   ```
   For each node I₍ᵢ₎:
     Verify proof-of-work
     Verify correct construction
     Verify temporal metadata
   ```

3. Validating temporal anchors:
   ```
   For each timestamp:
     Verify OpenTimestamps proof
     Verify Bitcoin block height
     Verify against local proofs
   ```

## 8. Difficulty Adjustment

The difficulty D adjusts to ensure proofs require real-time computation:

```
D₍ᵢ₎ = D₍ᵢ₋₁₎ * (T₍target₎ / T₍avg₎)
```

Where:
- T₍target₎ is target computation time per segment
- T₍avg₎ is moving average of actual computation times

## 9. Attack Scenarios

### Alternative History Attack
Attempting to create a different version of segments:
- Requires recomputing all subsequent proofs
- Computationally infeasible in real-time

### Parallel Construction Attack
Attempting to maintain multiple valid trees:
- Requires separate computational resources
- Cannot share proof-of-work between trees

### Temporal Shift Attack
Attempting to modify recording timing:
- Conflicts with OpenTimestamps proofs
- Breaks proof-of-work timing chain

### Splice Attack
Attempting to combine multiple recordings:
- Breaks proof-of-work chain
- Invalidates merkle tree construction

## 10. Applications

The protocol enables new types of trustless applications:

1. Legal Evidence
   - Proves recording continuity
   - Establishes temporal bounds
   - Demonstrates active recording

4. Insurance Claims

## 11. Performance Considerations

For a video of duration T seconds:

1. Storage Requirements:
   - Video data: O(T)
   - Proof chain: O(T)
   - Merkle tree: O(log T)

2. Computation Requirements:
   - Segment proofs: O(T)
   - Tree construction: O(T log T)
   - Verification: O(T)

3. Memory Requirements:
   - During recording: O(log T)
   - For verification: O(1)

## 12. Implementation Guidelines

1. Segment Processing:
   - Fixed 1-second segments
   - Parallel proof computation
   - Efficient tree construction

2. Proof-of-Work:

   - Adaptive difficulty
   - Memory-hard variants

3. Timestamp Integration:

   - Local timestamp verification

## 13. Conclusion

We have proposed a system for digital video recording that proves continuous observation through proof-of-work secured merkle trees combined with Bitcoin timechain anchoring. This creates unforgeable evidence of both when a recording was made and its internal continuity, enabling new forms of trustless digital observation.
